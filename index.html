<h1>Battlebits Manual</h1>

<h2>What is Battlebits?</h2>

<p>Battlebits is a stream RPG battling minigame on Twitch.</p>

<p>
    Currently in <em>alpha</em>. This document will change as development progresses.<br>
    Follow <a href="http://twitter.com/BERDGames">@BERDGames on Twitter</a> for development updates once Battlebits hits beta!
</p>

<h2>Put me in the ring, coach!</h2>

<p>To join the battle, you can either</p>

<ul>
<li>Cheer any amount of bits</li>
<li>Subscribe or resubscribe to the channel</li>
<li>Following the channel</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cheering</h3>

<p>When you cheer, you can do one of two things; join the battle or support a combatant.</p>

<h4>Fighting</h4>

<p>To join the battle, you don't have to do anything special, just cheer away!<br>
The amount of bits you cheer equals the amount of health you'll get.</p>

<p>Additionally, you can pick a job to grant yourself extra perks while fighting.<br>
To pick a job, you just add the corresponding hashtag in your message. Check the Jobs heading below to see which jobs you can pick.</p>

<p>If a battle is already in progress, you will be put in the queue. Otherwise, you will be put in the empty spot.</p>

<p>If you're already battling, you will heal yourself instead. You do not need to add #left or #right to heal yourself.<br>
You can also change jobs if you want. Just add the new job's hashtag in the message and you'll switch jobs.</p>

<h4>Supporting</h4>

<p>To support a person on the battlefield, you can cheer using either #left or #right in your message.
This will heal the person with the amount of bits you used in your message.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If there is no person in that spot, you will enter that spot as a combatant.</p>

<h4>Rank</h4>

<p>When you join as a combatant, you will be given a rank depending on how much you cheered.<br>
You can also advance in rank if you heal yourself or if someone supports you to get over the thresholds.<br>
Rank does not influence the battle in any way, it is purely cosmetic.</p>

<p>The ranks are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>1: 1 - 99</li>
<li>2: 100 - 999</li>
<li>3: 1000 - 4999</li>
<li>4: 5000 - 9999</li>
<li>5: 10000 and above</li>
</ul>

<h3>Subscribing</h3>

<p>When you subscribe or resubscribe to the channel, you will be entered as a combatant with 500 health, as if you cheered 500 bits.<br>
You will get a randomly assigned job.</p>

<h3>Following</h3>

<p>When you follow the channel, you will be entered as a combatant with 10 health, as if you cheered 10 bits. You cannot pick a job.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Following is only counted once. Unfollowing and re-following will not count.</p>

<h2>The Fight</h2>

<p>Each fight consists of quick turns. The battle continues until one or both combatants reach 0 HP.<br>
One turn consists of either an attack or a heal. Attacks can miss.</p>

<h2>Jobs</h2>

<p>There are four jobs in Battlebits</p>

<ul>
<li>Freelancer</li>
<li>Paladin</li>
<li>White Mage</li>
<li>Ninja</li>
</ul>

<p>Each job, aside from Freelancer, has traits and abilities that occur troughout the battle.<br>
Freelancer is the default job, and as such has no special abilities or traits.</p>

<p><strong>Traits</strong> are passive effects unique to each job.</p>

<p><strong>Abilities</strong> are time-activated effects. You cannot decide when to activate them, they will be activated during the course of the battle.</p>

<p><strong>Ability</strong>: Stun<br>

While active, the opponent cannot attack, heal or use abilities.</p>

<h3>White Mage (#whm)</h3>

<p><strong>Trait</strong>: Healing<br>
Has a chance to heal themselves instead of dealing damage.</p>

<p><strong>Ability</strong>: Regen<br>
The White Mage casts Regen, causing them to continously heal.<br>
While active, in addition to the damage or healing done that turn, an additional flat value heal is performed.</p>
