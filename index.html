    <li>Power</li>
    <li>Rank</li>
    <li>Job</li>
</ol>

<h2>Put me in the ring, coach!</h2>

<p>To join the battle, you can either</p>

<ul>
<li>Cheer any amount of bits</li>
<li>Subscribe or resubscribe to the channel</li>
<li>Following the channel</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cheering</h3>

<p>When you cheer, you can do one of two things; join the battle or support a combatant.</p>

<h4>Fighting</h4>

<p>To join the battle, you don't have to do anything special, just cheer away!<br>
The amount of bits you cheer when you join the battle equals the amount of health you'll start with.</p>

<p>Additionally, you can pick a job to grant yourself extra perks while fighting.<br>
To pick a job, you just add the corresponding hashtag in your message. Check the Jobs heading below to see which jobs you can pick.</p>

<p>If a battle is already in progress, you will be put in the queue. Otherwise, you will be put in the empty spot.</p>

<p>If you're already battling, you will add power to yourself instead. You do not need to add #left or #right to add power yourself.<br>
You can also change jobs if you want. Just add the new job's hashtag in the message and you'll switch jobs.</p>

<h4>Supporting</h4>

<p>To support a person on the battlefield, you can cheer by putting either #left or #right in your message.<br>
This will give the person you cheer on power. The amount of bits corresponds to how much power you'll give them.<br>
If you want to heal the person, see the Healing header below.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If there is no person in that spot, you will enter that spot as a combatant.</p>

<h4>Rank</h4>

<p>When you join as a combatant, you will be given a rank depending on how much you cheered.<br>
You can also advance in rank if you heal yourself or if someone supports you to get over the thresholds.<br>
Rank does not influence the battle in any way, it is purely cosmetic.</p>

<p>The ranks are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>1: 1 - 99</li>
<li>2: 100 - 999</li>
<li>3: 1000 - 4999</li>
<li>4: 5000 - 9999</li>
<li>5: 10000 and above</li>
</ul>

<h3>Subscribing</h3>

<p>When you subscribe or resubscribe to the channel, you will be entered as a combatant with 500 health, as if you cheered 500 bits.<br>
You will get a randomly assigned job.</p>

<h3>Following</h3>

<p>When you follow the channel, you will be entered as a combatant with 10 health, as if you cheered 10 bits. You cannot pick a job.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Following is only counted once. Unfollowing and re-following will not count.</p>

<h2>The Fight</h2>

<p>Each fight consists of quick turns. The battle continues until one or both combatants reach 0 HP.<br>
One turn consists of either an attack or a heal (depending on the job). Attacks can miss.</p>

<h2>Power</h2>

<p>During the fight, you'll accumulate power over time or when you or someone else cheers for you.</p>
<p>Power has two uses right now: Limit Break and healing.</p>

<h3>Healing (#heal or #powerHeal)</h3>

<p>If you want to heal instead of adding power, add #heal to the message. This will use all the bits in the message to heal instead.<br>
If you are fighting, you can tap into power to heal by using #powerHeal. This will use up all the bits in the message and all of your power to heal yourself.</p>

<p>If you don't want to use all of the bits and/or power, you can specify an amount to #heal&gt;amount&lt; and #powerHeal&gt;amount&lt;.<br>
For example, if you cheer with 500 bits and use #heal200, you'll get 200 HP and get 300 power.<br>
If you're fighting, cheer using 300 bits and use #powerHeal200, you'll get 200 HP and get 100 power.<br>
If you instead use #powerHeal400, you'll use all 300 bits and 100 of your power to heal for 400 HP.</p>

<h3>Limit Break (#lb)</h3>

<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 500 power<br>
If you have 500 power, you can use a Limit Break to deal 1000 damage by adding #lb to your cheer message.<br>
Bits are also counted to the power cost, so you can have 450 power and cheer 50 bits and activate the Limit Break.<br>
Only the person fighting can initiate a Limit Break.</p>

<h2>Jobs</h2>

<p>There are four jobs in Battlebits</p>

<ul>
<li>Freelancer</li>
<li>Paladin</li>
<li>White Mage</li>
<li>Ninja</li>
</ul>

<p>Each job, aside from Freelancer, has traits and abilities that occur troughout the battle.<br>
Freelancer is the default job, and as such has no special abilities or traits.</p>

<p><strong>Traits</strong> are passive effects unique to each job.</p>

<p><strong>Abilities</strong> are time-activated effects. You cannot decide when to activate them, they will be activated during the course of the battle.</p>

<h3>Paladin (#pld)</h3>

<p><strong>Trait</strong>: Block<br>
Has a chance to halve the damage taken.</p>

<p><strong>Ability</strong>: Stun<br>
The Paladin stuns the opponent for a short period of time.<br>
While active, the opponent cannot attack, heal or use abilities.</p>

<h3>White Mage (#whm)</h3>

<p><strong>Trait</strong>: Healing<br>
Has a chance to heal themselves instead of dealing damage.</p>

<p><strong>Ability</strong>: Regen<br>
The White Mage casts Regen, causing them to continously heal.<br>
While active, in addition to the damage or healing done that turn, an additional flat value heal is performed.</p>

<h3>Ninja (#nin)</h3>

<p><strong>Trait</strong>: Crit<br>

<p><strong>Ability</strong>: Huton<br>
